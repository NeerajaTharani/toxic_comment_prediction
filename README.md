# Toxic Comment Prediction

This repository provides a robust implementation of a machine learning pipeline for toxic comment prediction. The model classifies comments into categories such as **toxic**, **severe toxic**, **obscene**, **threat**, **insult**, and **identity hate**. The solution is designed to handle imbalanced data, preprocess text, and generate predictions using state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) techniques.

## ðŸš€ Features

- **Multi-Class Classification**: Categorizes comments into one or more toxic categories.
- **State-of-the-Art Models**: Implements transformer-based models like BERT for high accuracy.
- **Custom Preprocessing Pipeline**: Cleans text data to improve prediction performance.
- **Data Handling**: Effectively manages imbalanced datasets with resampling techniques.
- **Scalable and Extensible**: Modular design allows easy customization and integration.
